# [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) app using [Angular](https://angular.io/) & [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)

Based on code from the GDG Toulouse talk "Redux with Angular & ngrx" in February 2018 (See [`bbaia/gdgtoulouse-ngrx`](https://github.com/bbaia/gdgtoulouse-ngrx)).

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
